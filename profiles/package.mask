# Pale Moon 27 isn't very mature yet. If you want to give it a try anyway be
# sure to make a backup of your `~/.moonchild productions` directory, since
# after the upgrade it won't be compatible with the previous versions
# any more, in case you'll want to downgrade.
# Moreover, when built with gcc >=5 Pale Moon is highly unstable, so you are
# prevented from building it if you are on a 5.* profile. You can use
# gcc-config to change your compiler profile, just remember to change it back
# afterwards. You need to have the appropriate versions of gcc installed for
# them to be shown in gcc-config.
