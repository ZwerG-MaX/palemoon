# When built with gcc >=5 Pale Moon is highly unstable, so you are
# prevented from building it if you are on a 5.* profile. You can use
# gcc-config to change your compiler profile, just remember to change it back
# afterwards. You need to have the appropriate versions of gcc installed for
# them to be shown in gcc-config.
